# MCP Browser Agent Design Document

## Executive Summary

The MCP Browser Agent is an intelligent web automation system that translates natural language queries into browser actions. It leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide a standardized interface between AI models and browser automation capabilities, enabling complex web research, data extraction, and interaction tasks.

## System Architecture
